U of R CS/Math Co-op Playbook 🛠️
=================================

> **"Show, Don't Tell."**

Welcome to the unofficial, community-driven guide to landing Tech and Data internships at the University of Regina.

The Problem
-----------

Standard university resume advice is often designed to be "one size fits all." It works great for Arts or Business majors, where the focus is on soft skills and narrative.

**It often fails Computer Science and Math students.**

Tech recruiters do not care that you are a "hard worker" or "passionate learner." They want to know:

1.  What can you build?

2.  What stack do you know?

3.  Can you prove it?

The Philosophy
--------------

This repository is built on three rules:

1.  **Code > Claims:** Don't list "Python" in your skills. Link to a project where you used it.

2.  **Coursework IS Experience:** A complex final project in CS 210 is more valuable than a generic customer service job.

3.  **ATS Compliance:** We use formats that robots (Applicant Tracking Systems) can read. No columns, no graphics, no photos.

How to Use This Repo
--------------------

### 📂 /Templates (Coming Soon)

Clean, ATS-friendly resume templates in `.docx` and LaTeX.

### 📂 /Course_Translator

**Stop listing course codes.** Recruiters don't know what "CS 215" is. Use our "Mad Libs" style bullets to translate your academic assignments into professional technical experience.

### 📂 /The_Retail_Pivot (Coming Soon)

Have a survival job (Server, Retail, Fast Food)? Learn how to translate "taking orders" into "high-concurrency task management" for technical roles.

### 📂 /AI_Prompts (Coming Soon)

Don't ask ChatGPT to "write your resume." Use our engineering-focused prompts to roast and refine your bullet points.

⚠️ Disclaimer
-------------

**DO NOT COPY-PASTE.** The examples in this repository use `[brackets like this]` to force you to input your specific project details. If 50 students apply to the same job with the exact same resume text, **all 50 will be rejected.** Use these as a framework, not a script.
