💻 The Tech Co-op Playbook
===============================

A "Mad Libs" style resume and career document generator, structured like a software project.

> **⚠️ compilation_error:** Do not submit resumes with `[brackets]`. You MUST replace variables with your own data. Submitting a template as-is will result in a runtime error (Rejection).

🚀 The Workflow
---------------

Treat your job search like a dev cycle.

### 1\. `npm install` (Setup)

Navigate to `/build_targets`.

-   **Level 0 User:** Open `/Level_0_Starter` for a basic template.

-   **Level 50 User:** Open `/Level_50_Veteran` for advanced layouts.

### 2\. `import { experience } from 'source_code'`

Open the `/source_code` directory to find your "functions" (bullet points).

-   **`CS_Core.md`**: Logic & structure variables (Algorithms, Data Structs).

-   **`CS_Electives.md`**: Specialized tech variables (AI, Web, Networks).

-   **`Math_Stat.md`**: Quant & analytical variables.

-   **`Survival_Jobs.md`**: Retail & service industry translation layers.

*Copy the best "functions" that match your history.*

### 3\. `npm run build` (Compile)

Paste the bullets into your template. **CRITICAL STEP:** Fill in the `[brackets]` with your specific metrics, tools, and project names.

-   Bad: "Built a website."

-   Good: "Architected `[Project Name]` using `[React/Vue]` to solve `[User Problem]`, reducing load times by `[X]%`."

### 4\. `npm test` (Linting)

Run your document against the checklists in `/linters`.

-   **`RESUME_LINTER.md`**: The pre-flight checklist. Checks for fatal errors (file names, cover sheets) and warnings (typos, bad formatting).

-   **`COVER_LETTER_GENERATOR.md`**: A "Hook" based template generator.
