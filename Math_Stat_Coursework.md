MATH 110/111: Calculus I & II
-----------------------------

*The Logic. Focus on optimization and rates of change.*

**Angle A: The Optimizer (Focus on Modeling)**

-   "Applied **Calculus-based optimization** techniques to model [Real World Scenario, e.g., fluid rates/profit max], determining critical points for maximum efficiency."

-   "Analyzed rates of change in [System Name] using **derivatives and integrals** to predict future states of the system."

MATH 122: Linear Algebra
------------------------

*The Data Foundation. Crucial for Machine Learning/Graphics.*

**Angle A: The Data Scientist (Focus on Matrices)**

-   "Utilized **matrix operations** and **eigenvalues** to transform and analyze multidimensional datasets related to [Topic]."

-   "Modeled [System Name] using **linear systems of equations**, applying **Gaussian elimination** to determine system consistency."

**Angle B: The Graphics Engineer (Focus on Vectors)**

-   "Applied **vector space theory** to simulate [3D movement/Physics] in a theoretical environment, calculating projections and transformations."

STAT 160/252: Intro to Stats & Probability
------------------------------------------

*The Analyst. Focus on inference and prediction.*

**Angle A: The Analyst (Focus on Inference)**
