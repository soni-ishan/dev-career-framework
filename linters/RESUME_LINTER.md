🛑 RESUME_LINTER.md (The "Pre-Flight Checklist")
================================================

Run your resume through this checklist before hitting "Submit". Treat these like compilation errors---if one fails, the build breaks.

🔴 FATAL ERROR: University Constraints
--------------------------------------

*Violating these may lead to immediate rejection.*

-   [ ] **Cover Sheet:** Did you include the mandatory "Resume Cover Sheet" for Career Connect?

-   [ ] **File Naming:** Is the file name exactly `Firstname_Lastname_JobTitle.pdf`?

-   [ ] **Format:** Is it a PDF? (No Word docs).

-   [ ] **ATS Structure:** Are there columns, text boxes, or graphics? (If YES -> **DELETE**. Use a single-column layout to parse correctly in Applicant Tracking Systems).

⚠️ WARNING: Content Quality
---------------------------

*These won't crash the build, but they will cause runtime errors (rejection).*

-   [ ] **References:** Did you REMOVE "References available upon request"? (It is outdated and wastes space. Recruiters ask later).

-   [ ] **Contact Info:** Is your phone number included? (University Requirement: Must be a professional, local number).

-   [ ] **Hyperlinks:** Are LinkedIn and GitHub URLs full and clickable? (Don't make them copy-paste).

-   [ ] **Address:** Did you remove your full street address? (City and Province is sufficient).

-   [ ] **Dynamic Coursework:** Did you tweak your "Relevant Coursework" list? (e.g., Don't list Networking if applying for a Web Dev role; list CS 215 instead).

-   [ ] **Spell Check:** Run a final spell check. (Typos = Immediate "No").

🎨 STYLE CHECK: Visuals & Length
--------------------------------

-   [ ] **Length:** 1 page maximum (Level 0) or 1.5 pages max (Level 50). Never 2 pages unless you have a commendable experience + project portfolio.

-   [ ] **Margins:** Are they narrow enough to maximize space but wide enough to breathe? (e.g., 0.5" - 0.75").

-   [ ] **Font:** Is it readable? (Aptos, Calibri, Roboto). Keep size 10-12pt.

-   [ ] **The "HR Secret":** Did you use a *subtle* accent color for headers (e.g., dark blue)?

    -   *Note:* An HR rep mentioned this helps them sort through piles of black-and-white docs. Don't go crazy, just a splash of color for headers.

🧪 UNIT TEST: The "Roast" Prompt
--------------------------------

*Copy-paste this into an LLM (ChatGPT/Gemini) to stress-test your bullets.*

> "Act as a strict Technical Recruiter. Review my resume.
>
> 1.  Identify the 3 weakest bullet points and explain WHY they are weak.
>
>
> 2.  Point out any 'fluff' words (e.g., 'passionate', 'hard worker') that I should delete.
>
>
> 3.  Rate the 'Evidence vs. Claims' ratio. Do I prove my skills, or just list them? Be harsh and specific."
