# 🛑 RESUME_LINTER.md (The "Pre-Flight Checklist")

Run your resume through this checklist before hitting "Submit". Treat these like compilation errors—if one fails, the build breaks.

## 🔴 FATAL ERROR: University Constraints
*Violating these leads to immediate rejection by the Co-op Office.*

- [ ] **Cover Sheet:** Did you include the mandatory "Resume Cover Sheet" for Career Connect?
- [ ] **File Naming:** Is the file name exactly `Firstname_Lastname_JobTitle.pdf`?
- [ ] **Format:** Is it a PDF? (No Word docs).
- [ ] **ATS Structure:** Are there columns, text boxes, or graphics? (If YES -> **DELETE**. Use a single-column layout to parse correctly in Applicant Tracking Systems).

## ⚠️ WARNING: Content Quality
*These won't crash the build, but they will cause runtime errors (rejection).*

- [ ] **Contact Info:** Are full, clickable URLs included for LinkedIn and GitHub?
- [ ] **Contact:** Is your phone number local and professional? (University Requirement)
- [ ] **References:** Did you REMOVE "References available upon request"? (Recruiters ask for this later; don't waste the pixels).
- [ ] **Spell Check:** Run a final spell check. (Typos = Lack of attention to detail).
- [ ] **Fluff:** Did you delete generic phrases like "hard worker" or "passionate"? (Show, don't tell).

## 🎨 STYLE CHECK: Visuals & Length
- [ ] **Length:** 1 page maximum (unless you have 10+ years experience).
- [ ] **Margins:** Are they narrow enough to maximize space but wide enough to breathe? (e.g., 0.5" - 0.75").
- [ ] **Font:** Is it readable (Aptos, Calibri) and 10-12pt?
- [ ] **Color:** (Optional) Did you use a *subtle* accent color for headers (e.g., dark blue) to stand out in a pile of black-and-white?

## 🧪 UNIT TEST: The "Roast" Prompt
*Copy-paste this into an LLM to stress-test your bullets.*

> "Act as a strict Technical Recruiter. Review my resume.
> 1. Identify the 3 weakest bullet points and explain WHY they are weak.
> 2. Point out any 'fluff' words I should delete.
> 3. Rate the 'Evidence vs. Claims' ratio. Be harsh and specific."
