Contributing to the Developer's Career Framework
================================================

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! This guide is community-driven, and your experience helps the next batch of students survive the job hunt.

How Can You Help?
-----------------

### 1\. Add a Course Translation

Did you take a class we haven't listed?

-   Submit a Pull Request adding a new section to `source_code/CS_Core.md` or `source_code/CS_Electives.md`.

-   Provide 2-3 "Angles" (e.g., The Builder, The Researcher) so students have options.

-   **Rule:** Use `[brackets]` for specific project names to prevent plagiarism.

### 2\. Add a Retail Pivot

Did you work a job we missed (e.g., Lifeguard, Uber Driver, Farm Hand)?

-   Submit a Pull Request to `source_code/Survival_Jobs.md`.

-   Explain how that job translates to **Data**, **Dev**, or **Support** roles.

### 3\. Share a Template

Did you land a FAANG job with a specific resume layout?

-   Share the structure in the `build_targets` folder.

-   Ensure it is ATS-friendly (no columns, no graphics).
