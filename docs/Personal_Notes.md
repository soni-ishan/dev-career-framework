🧠 Personal Notes & "Unpopular" Opinions
========================================

> **Context:** This file contains raw, tactical advice collected from 4 co-op terms, career fairs, and coffee chats. Some of this contradicts "standard" advice, but it has been battle-tested in the real world.

🎨 The "HR Secret" (Visuals)
----------------------------

-   **The "Splash of Color" Hack:** An HR representative at a career fair explicitly told me to add **color** to section headers (e.g., Navy Blue or Dark Green).

    -   *Why?* They review hundreds of black-and-white text documents daily. A subtle pop of color makes your resume physically easier to scan and helps it stand out in a pile.

-   **Margins & Font:** Use narrow margins (0.5" - 0.75") to maximize real estate. Use clean, modern fonts like **Aptos**, **Calibri**, or **Roboto** (10-12pt). Times New Roman looks dated.

🚫 What to Cut (The "Anti-Fluff" List)
--------------------------------------

-   **References:** "References available upon request" is a waste of pixels. Recruiters know they are available. If they want them, they will ask *after* the interview.

-   **Full Address:** No one is mailing you a letter. City and Province (e.g., "Regina, SK") is sufficient.

-   **Generic Objectives:** Stop writing "Active student leader managing communications." It means nothing. Show, don't tell.

🛠️ Content Strategy
--------------------

-   **The "Zero Experience" Fix:** If you have no job history, your **Class Projects** are your job history.

    -   *CS 115:* You didn't "do an assignment"; you "Built a text-based RPG engine."

    -   *CS 215:* You didn't "learn HTML"; you "Architected a persistent web application."

-   **The "Dual Degree" Edge:** If you are Math + CS, highlight it. Data Analyst roles love this combination. Position yourself as the bridge between "The Math Guys" and "The Dev Guys."

-   **Tweak the Coursework:** Never use a static list of courses.

    -   *Applying for Web Dev?* List CS 215, CS 310.

    -   *Applying for Networks?* List CS 335, CS 490DJ.

-   **The "Team Project" Trap:** A hiring manager explicitly told me: **"You must be able to talk about** ***your*** **specific role within a team."**

    -   *Tip:* Don't just list the project's features. Isolate *your* contribution. If the app had a Login, Database, and UI, and you only built the Login... write about the Login. This sets you up for success in the interview.

🔄 The Pivot: Specific Role Translations
----------------------------------------

*Advice on translating specific U of R experiences:*

### 1\. The Math Tutor

-   **Bad:** "Encouraged problem-solving."

-   **Good:** "Improved student test scores by [X]% by diagnosing logic gaps in Calculus concepts." (Focus on **Results**, not tasks).

### 2\. The Night Auditor

-   **Bad:** "Checked guests in."

-   **Good:** "Managed [Software Name] to reconcile daily financial ledgers with 100% accuracy." (Focus on **Software** and **Accuracy**).

### 3\. MASS (Math Actuarial & Stats Society)

-   **Bad:** "Member of the club."

-   **Good:** "Analyzed social media engagement metrics using [Tool], increasing event turnout by [X]%." (Focus on **Analytics**).

⚠️ A Note on Phone Numbers
--------------------------

-   **My original opinion:** "I prefer not to include my phone number for privacy, but be aware most standard templates require it."

-   **The Reality:** The University Co-op Office **requires** it, and local Regina employers still like to call. I have conceded this point in the `RESUME_LINTER.md`. Include it, but make sure your voicemail is professional.
