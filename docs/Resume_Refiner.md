🤖 AI Resume Refiner Prompts
============================

**Stop asking ChatGPT to "Write my resume."** It produces generic, robotic text that recruiters hate. Instead, use these engineering-focused prompts to act as a force multiplier for your own writing.

1\. The "Roast" (Critique & Feedback)
-------------------------------------

*Use this to find weak spots in your current resume.*

> "Act as a strict Technical Recruiter for a [Target Role, e.g., Google Software Engineer]. Review the resume pasted below.
>
> 1.  Identify the 3 weakest bullet points and explain WHY they are weak.
>
>
> 2.  Point out any 'fluff' words (e.g., 'passionate', 'hard worker') that I should delete.
>
>
> 3.  Rate the 'Evidence vs. Claims' ratio. Do I prove my skills, or just list them? Be harsh and specific."

2\. The "Translator" (Tailoring to a Job Description)
-----------------------------------------------------

*Use this when applying to a specific job to ensure you hit the keywords.*

> "I am applying for this specific Job Description (JD): `[Paste Job Description Here]`
>
> Here is my current resume: `[Paste Resume Here]`
>
> **Task:** Rewrite my 'Projects' and 'Professional Experience' bullet points to strictly align with the keywords and priorities found in the JD. **Constraint:** Do not invent facts. Only rephrase my existing experience to match the terminology used in the JD. Highlight the specific keywords you inserted."

3\. The "Bullet Point Builder" (Action-Task-Result)
---------------------------------------------------

*Use this when you have a rough idea of what you did, but can't make it sound professional.*

> "I need to write a resume bullet point for my time as a [Job Title, e.g., Barista].
>
> **What I actually did:** I worked the morning shift, it was super busy, I handled the cash register, and I trained a new guy.
>
> **Target Role:** I am applying for a Data Analyst internship.
>
> **Task:** Write 3 different options for this bullet point using the 'Action + Task + Result' format. Focus on efficiency, accuracy, and training. Use strong action verbs."

4\. The "Cold Email" Architect
------------------------------

*Use this to generate networking messages that get replies.*

> "I want to reach out to a [Role, e.g., Senior Developer] at [Company] via LinkedIn.
>
> **My Goal:** I want to ask them about their team's tech stack, NOT ask for a job directly. **My Background:** I am a CS student interested in [Specific Tech].
>
> **Task:** Draft a 50-word message that is polite, specific, and asks a smart technical question to start a conversation. Do not sound desperate."
