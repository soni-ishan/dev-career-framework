- Do a spell check; Resumes with spelling errors will automatically rejected
- Write the complete URLs for Linkedin and GitHub profile link
- Do not write your phone number
- If you are just starting out, your resume should be only 1 or one and a half page max
- Use narrow margins and a clear readable 12 point font like aptos or calibri
- Do not write references in resume. It is outdated and takes up space on the page. Recruiters ask for reference after the interview.
- Since you just starting out, you don't have a lot of experience. So include any projects you have done to show proof of your technical skills. If haven't done any projects, write about your class projects, like in CS 115 you would have made a text based adventure game or if have done CS 215 you would have made a website. Include these as proof of work.
- Avoid writing generic statements like "Active student leader managing communications"
- Highlight how your combined degree in CS + Math is beneficial for a job role like for a data analyst
- In your math tutor experience, instead of writing "Encouraged problem-solving and critical thinking", write about results. Like were you able to improve student scores?
- In your overnight auditor experience, write about any particular software you used. or did you implement any process to make the audit process faster?
- In your MASS experience, if you used any analytical tools to see the performance of the social media accounts, write about it and include how much improvement was there in the performance
- Change your relevant coursework section according to the job. For a networking job, list classes like CS 335
- you will need to tweak your resume for almost every job. it won't be a major change though. like if your resume currently has networking classes in relevant coursework, you would want to change it to include the web and database programming class if you are applying for a web developer position
- one of the HRs at the career fair told me to have some color in the resume, like maybe a different color for headings, not anything too fancy though, this is because they have to look through hundreds of resumes and comb through black and white documents to sort out the selected candidates to pass on to the hiring manager. having a bit of color is easier on their eyes and would probably make your resume stand out
